# google_data_analytics
Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics certificate. The dataset comes from Kaggle's public database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset

We use data analytics to understand which variables have the highest correlations with sleep disorders such as Sleep Apnea and Insomnia.
